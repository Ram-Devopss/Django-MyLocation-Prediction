# Django-MyLocation-Prediction

**Project Name:** My Next Location Prediction  
**Technology Used:** Django Framework (Python)

## Description:
This project, **Django-MyLocation-Prediction**, aims to predict a user's next possible location based on their given location history. By utilizing latitude and longitude data, the application provides accurate map links using Google Earth, helping users visualize and track location patterns.

## Features:
- User location prediction based on latitude and longitude data.
- Interactive map integration using Google Earth links.
- User authentication with email verification.
- Clean and responsive UI design for easy navigation.
  
## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Django >= 3.x
- Google Maps API
- SQLite3 (or any other database supported by Django)
- Other dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/Django-MyLocation-Prediction.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Start the Django development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## How It Works:
1. **Signup/Login:**  
   Users can create an account or log in using their credentials.
   
2. **Email Verification:**  
   A verification link is sent to the user's email to confirm their identity.
   
3. **Location Input:**  
   Users provide latitude and longitude values from their past locations.
   
4. **Next Location Prediction:**  
   The system processes the user's location data and predicts the next possible location. The predicted location can be viewed on Google Earth for visualization.

## Future Enhancements:
- Integration with machine learning algorithms for more accurate predictions.
- Advanced data visualization to analyze location trends.
- Support for real-time location tracking.
